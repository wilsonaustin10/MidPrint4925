      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the task into subtasks such as running the create-next-app command, configuring the settings (e.g., ESLint, Tailwind CSS), and verifying the development server setup.",
      "reasoning": "This task is straightforward as it primarily involves running commands and minimal configuration. However, ensuring proper setup and functionality requires a structured approach."

      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Consider subtasks like creating the Layout component file, defining the layout structure using Flexbox/Grid, and testing the placeholder content rendering.",
      "reasoning": "The task is moderately complex due to the need to establish a reusable layout structure with proper styling and placeholders."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail subtasks such as creating the component file, applying basic styles, and testing the placeholder rendering with props integration.",
      "reasoning": "The task involves some design and coding effort to ensure the component is styled and functional, but the placeholder content simplifies testing."

      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks such as creating the component file, adding basic styling and placeholder content, and testing children props functionality.",
      "reasoning": "Similar to the Left Panel, this task requires a clear structure and basic styling, making it manageable but not trivial."

      "taskTitle": "Create CSS Module for Layout Styling",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Subtasks might include defining the CSS module file, implementing Flexbox/Grid styles for layout, creating variables for dimensions, and testing the visual appearance.",
      "reasoning": "The complexity arises from ensuring accurate styling proportions and adaptability for future changes through variables."

      "taskTitle": "Integrate Panel Components into Layout",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Subtasks could include importing panel components, integrating them into the layout, applying CSS styles, and verifying the 25/75 split functionality.",
      "reasoning": "The integration step adds complexity due to the need for proper nesting, styling, and functional testing of the overall layout."

      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break into subtasks like defining media queries, implementing vertical stacking for narrow screens, testing transitions, and validating responsiveness.",
      "reasoning": "Responsive design introduces complexity as it requires handling varying viewport sizes and ensuring smooth transitions."

      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Include subtasks such as modifying the main page to import the layout, removing starter content, and adding metadata using the Head component.",
      "reasoning": "Integrating the layout into the Next.js structure is straightforward but requires attention to detail to ensure proper configuration and metadata."
